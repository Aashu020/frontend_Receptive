            Pathway to PR through Subclass 482 visa
          </h3>
          <p className="text-left text-gray-700">
            The Subclass 482 Temporary Skill Shortage visa can provide a pathway to permanent residency in Australia through the Temporary Residence Transition stream of the Employer Nomination Scheme (subclass 186) visa. To be eligible for this pathway, individuals must have held a Subclass 482 visa under the same employer for at least three years, and their employer must nominate them for permanent residency.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3 text-left text-gray-700">
            The process involves meeting certain requirements, including having the necessary skills, qualifications, and experience for the nominated occupation, as well as meeting English language proficiency and health and character requirements. Applicants must also demonstrate a genuine intention to work for the nominating employer in the nominated position on a permanent basis.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3 text-left text-gray-700">
            Securing a Subclass 482 visa can provide skilled workers with the opportunity to gain valuable work experience in Australia and potentially transition to permanent residency, allowing them to build a future in the country.
