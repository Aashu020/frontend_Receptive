                        The process of obtaining a Canadian work permit varies depending on the type of permit sought. International students in Canada may be granted permission to work part-time as part of their study permit. For most closed work permit applications, a job offer from a Canadian employer accompanied by a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) is required. It is important for individuals exempt from the LMIA or not needing a work permit to be aware of the specific documents needed for entry into Canada. Closed work permits, tied to a specific employer, and open work permits are the two main types of work permits in Canada. Those with closed work permits must remain with the same employer at the same location unless their permit is modified.
